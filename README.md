# Manage your email in ChatGPT ‚úâÔ∏èü¶ú

REST API service for ChatGPT to access your email. Wouldn't it be fanstastic if you could access your email in ChatGPT? With custom GPT builder and Actions it is possible. This repository contains server that gives access to your email by REST API. The ChatGPT can interact with it. This server makes access to **only one** email address. It should be configured in `.env` file. See details below. This server gives access to email reading/sending by auth token that is created when server is starting. 

There are only two endpoints available:
- `read_email`
- `send_email`
[Here](https://api.mail4gpt.com/schema/swagger-ui/) is Swagger UI with endpoints docs.
